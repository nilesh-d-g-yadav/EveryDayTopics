## Service Bus
* Azure Service Bus is a cloud-based messaging platform that allows for scalable distributed systems to send messages between applications or devices. It uses the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) for Microsoft and is supported by Windows Server Service Bus through.NET 4.5 and above.
* AMQP is a standard protocol for messaging and is used by many systems, including Microsoft's Azure Service Bus. It is used for interoperability between systems running on different platforms and environments.
* Azure Service Bus provides secure and reliable communication for disconnected systems, allowing messages to be sent to other applications even if they are not running in the same datacenter or on the same machine.
* It also supports publish-subscribe and request/reply patterns, which work seamlessly together. Azure Service Bus also offers an on-premise service bus, which allows users to host their own messaging infrastructure.


## Event Hub
* Azure Event Hubs is a cloud-based event streaming platform powered by Microsoft Azure that collects, consumes, and distributes real-time event data from multiple sources. 
* It offers high throughput, scalability, storage, partitioning, publish-subscribe model, event capture, and advanced security options like shared access rights and Azure Active Directory integration.
* It is suitable for businesses and developers with high data requirements, offering reliability, scalability, and operational efficiency.
